## Problem Statement
Air pollution, specifically particulate matter (PM), poses significant health risks and environmental challenges. Predicting future PM levels can aid in mitigating these risks by enabling proactive measures. This project aims to develop a robust time series model to accurately forecast PM concentrations using historical data, thereby providing valuable insights for policy-makers, researchers, and the general public to improve air quality management and public health outcomes.
